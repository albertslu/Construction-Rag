## **Objective:**

Create a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot that can analyze architectural drawings and accurately answer questions about materials, measurements, and specifications.

## **Resources:**

[Folder of architectural drawings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rrfXJyTyiooZ-5nr7C0k5N6Fc5JnMQxv?usp=sharing) 

*If you would like, you can use a subset (at least 50). If you do, give me the list you used.

## **Common Drawing Elements:**

- **Dimensions:** Measurements showing sizes of rooms, spaces, and elements (typically in feet/inches or meters)
- **Material Indicators:** Symbols, hatching patterns, or text annotations specifying construction materials
- **Notes:** Text providing specific instructions, requirements, or clarifications
- **Symbols:** Standard architectural symbols representing doors, windows, fixtures, etc.
- **Scales:** References indicating the proportion between drawing and actual size
- **Legends:** Keys explaining symbols, abbreviations, and line types used in drawings

## **Guidelines**

- Tools: Use any programming languages, libraries, and AI tools
- Evaluation: You will be assessed on both technical implementation and creativity. Make sure your implementation is robust and handles edge cases well.
- What to submit:
    - The repo
    - Either a link to your deployed app or instructions to spin it up locally
    - A short video (e.g., a Loom) describing your solution and showing it in action

## **Success Criteria**

- Accuracy of answers
- Ability to handle ambiguity in drawings
- Performance with complex, multi-drawing queries
- Creativity of user-facing features (drawing highlighting, knowledge graph creation, etc.)
